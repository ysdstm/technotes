===== Invocation Syntax =====

XXCOPY src [ dst ] [ options... ]

        src  Specifies the source file(s) or directory to copy.
        dst  Specifies the destination directory (no file names).
             If dst ends with a trailing backslash, /I is assumed.
             When any pathname is specified with an embedded blank,
             the pathname must be surrounded by a pair of doublequotes.

 CAUTION:  The following list of the command description is *NOT*
           designed for new users to learn the XXCOPY command set.
           To quickly locate a short description of a command switch,
           use the /HELPA command for the alphabetic listing.
           For a better organized listing, see XXTB #27 at:

      -----  The following switches use file attributes to select files -----

         /A  Same as /ATA. Copies only files with the archive attribute set.
             Doesn't change the attribute.
         /M  Copies only src files with the archive attribute set.
             Then, turns off the archive attribute of the source file.
  /AT<mask>  Selects files by the attribute bits (ACHSRo).
             You may use two or more /AT<mask> switches to specify multiple
             attributes required.  E.g., /ATA/ATH qualifies files with both
             the A(rchive) bit and the H(idden) bits.
             Or, you may use one /AT<mask> switch with multiple letters to
             select alternative attribute bits to select files.  E.g.,
             /ATAH qualifies a file which has either A-bit, H-bit or both.
  /AX<mask>  Excludes files with the specified attribute bits (ACHSRo).
             You may use two or more /AX<mask> switches to specify
             attribute bits to exclude files for file operations.  E.g.,
             /AXA/AXH excludes files with A-bit, H-bit, or both.
             Or, you may use one /AX<mask> switch with multiple letters to
             exclude files with only the specified combination of attribute
             bits.  E.g., /AXAH excludes files with both A-bit and H-bit.

      Note:  The /AT<mask> and /AX<mask> switches have opposite conjugation
             rules (the effects of combining attribute bits --- AND and OR).

        /A0  Cancels *ALL* /A, /M, /AT, and /AX switches.

      -----  The following switches modifiy the file attributes -----

        /AA  Sets   the src file archive bit (without actually copying).
        /AZ  Clears the src file archive bit (without actually copying).
             Note: Both /AA and /AZ implicitly set /H (can be overridden).
        /AC  Clears the arch attribute of the src file after file action.
        /AM  Marks (sets) the arch attribute of the src file after file action.
  /AN<mask>  Sets a new value to file attribute bits (replace the value).
             The <mask> value is a combination of letters, AHSRo.
      Note:  Unlike /AR and /AS, you cannot change the C-bit with /AN.
  /AR<mask>  Resets file attribute bits (clears specified bits).
  /AS<mask>  Sets file attribute bits (sets specified bits).

      Note:  The <mask> value for /AR and /AS specifies attributes (ACHSRo)
             whose bits are either reset or set respectively to the existing
             file attributes. Unspecified attributes bits are kept unchanged.
             You may use both the /AR and /AS switches in one command.

 /ARD<mask>  Resets dir attribute bits (clears specified bits).
 /ASD<mask>  Sets dir attribute bits (sets specified bits).

             /ARD and /ASD work on directories analogous to /AR and /AS.

      Note:  The /AA, /AN, /AR, /AS, /ARD, /ASD and /AZ switches modify the
             file attributes without copying the files to the destination,
             whereas the /A, /AT and /AX switches select files by the file
             attributes for various operations (copy, list, remove, etc.).

      -----  The following switches use other file attribute bits -----

         /H  Copies hidden and/or system files also.
        /H0  Excludes hidden and/or system files (default).
        /Ho  Copies hidden and/or system files only.
         /R  Allows overwrite/delete of read-only files.
        /R0  Cancels overwrite/delete of read-only files.

      -----  The following switches determine file attributes on copy -----

         /K  Keeps the source attributes including read-only (same as /KS).
        /KS  Keeps the source attributes including the read-only bit.
        /KD  Keeps the attributes of destination (overwritten) file.
        /KN  Sets the destination attributes to normal (only the A-bit).
        /K0  Keeps H-bit and S-bit, sets A-bit, clears R-bit (default).

      /KCDP  Sets dst dir's C-bit with that of its parent dir (default).
      /KCDD  Keeps dst dir's C-bit, a new dir gets its parent's C-bit.
      /KCDS  Sets dst dir's C-bit with that of src dir's C-bit.
      /KCDC  Always sets the C-bit of dst directory (compress).
      /KCDU  Always resets the C-bit of dst directory (uncompress).

      /KCFP  Sets dst file's C-bit with that of its parent dir (default).
      /KCFD  Keeps dst file's C-bit, a new file gets its parent's C-bit.
      /KCFS  Sets dst file's C-bit with that of src file's C-bit.
      /KCFC  Always sets the C-bit of dst file (compress).
      /KCFU  Always resets the C-bit of dst file (uncompress).

      Note:  The /Kx switches affect only A, R, H, and S bits of files,
             whereas /KCFx and /KCDx affect only the C-bit of files and
             directories, respectively.

      -----  The following switches are useful for backup and archive -----

        /BI  Backs up incrementally, different (by time/size) files only.
        /BA  Similar to /BI but includes dirs/files with different attrib.
        /BB  Backs up brand new files only (does not overwrite existing ones).
        /BN  Backs up newer files only      (includes brand new files).
        /Bo  Backs up older files only      (includes brand new files).
        /BX  Backs up different-date files  (includes brand new files).
        /BZ  Same as /BZX.
       /BZE  Backs up equal-size  files  (includes brand new files).
       /BZL  Backs up larger-size files  (includes brand new files).
       /BZS  Backs up smaller-size files (includes brand new files).
       /BZX  Backs up different-size files  (includes brand new files).
        /BE  Backs up exactly the same files(includes brand new files).
        /BS  Selects exactly the same files (this is useful with /RS).
        /BU  Standard Backup switch (a short form of /BACKUP).
        /B0  Undo any of /BA, /BI, /BB, /BN, /Bo, /BX, or /BZ switches.
         /U  Updates the files that already exist in destination.
        /SP  Spans the copy job over multiple destination (new volume).
       /CD0  Does not compare file data byte-by-byte (default).
       /CDM  Selects files whose data match in byte-by-byte comparison.
       /CDU  Selects files whose data unmatch and brand new files.
       /CDX  selects files whose data match byte-by-byte and brand new files.

     /CLONE  Duplicates a directory (volume).  This switch is a shortcut for
             the following combination: /KS/H/E/R/Q/Y/BI/ZY/ZE/oD0.
    /BACKUP  Standard Backup without deleting any file (/CLONE without /ZY).
             A shortcut for the following combination: /KS/H/E/R/Q/Y/BI/ZE/oD0.

      Note:  A "brand new" file refers to a file which exists in the
             source directory but not in the destination directory
             (Micrososoft's Robocopy call it a "lonely file").

      -----  The following switch adds inclusive alternate templates -----

  /IN<tmpl>  Includes an alternate filename template (tmpl).

             You may specify as many alternate filename patterns as you want.
             The template must be for the "Lastname" of the source specifier
             (no backslash in the template, but wildcard characters are OK).

      -----  The following switch selects filepaths in the include file -----

/EIN<inlst>  Specifies a text file with a list of filepaths to be included.
             Two or more /EIN switches may be specified in a command.
             The current version of XXCOPY does not support a wildcard
             in the included filepath. (This may change in the future.)

      Note:  Even with an /EIN switch present, the source specifier must always
             be furnished in the command line.  The destination directory is
             also required for operations that need one.

      Note:  When a filepath in an include file does not exist, or fails to
             match the path template in the source specifier, the file will
             not be selected in the operation.

      Note:  With an /EIN switch, XXCOPY will merge the entire set of included
             files for the job and sort the order of access, eliminating
             files duplicated and those that are outside of the source base

      Note:  The base path can be specified with a /BASE<path> switch that
             follows immediately after an /EIN switch to override the base
             directory when the original file list was generated.

/BASE<path>  Sets an optional base path for the paths in /EIN list file
             that appears immediately to its left in the command line.

      -----  The following switches exclude directories or files -----

  /X<xspec>  Adds an exclusion specifier (xspec) (see below for exclusion).
 /EX<xlist>  Specifies a text file which contains a list of xspecs (see below).

    <xspec>  Exclusion item for /X and the file contents specified by /EX.

             . The text file may contain an arbitrary number of xspecs which
               are separated by space, tab, or newline characters.
             . An xspec with embedded spaces must be surrounded by a pair
               of double-quote characters(").
             . An xspec cannot span from one line to another.
             . Two consecutive colons (::) or slashes (//) start a comment
               field which ends at the end of the line.
             . You may specify more than 1 exclusion file.  In such a
               case all of the exclusion files will be processed.

             Exclusion specifier (xspec) syntax:

             . You may use any number of wildcard characters (* or ?) anywhere
               in an exclusion specifier (Wild-Wildcard).
             . An xspec for directories must be followed by a backslash.
             . An xspec not followed by a backslash is for files.
             . To use the old syntax for directory_template\?\*, you must
               the /GX switch.  In lieu of the obsolete syntax, it is advised
               that the regular syntax (directorY_template\?*\*) be used.
             . A bare file template applies to all directories.
               E.g., *.mp3 is treated as *\*.mp3 (*\ is implicitly assumed).

             XXCOPY optimizes the exclusion parameter by eliminating
             some redundant specifiers.
             Use "/W/oX" with xspec to test the syntax.

      /ZLX0  Disables exclusion testing (default).
       /ZLX  Enables exclusion test (displays only excluded objects).

             Note: /ZLX performs a 'dry-run' (like /L) without copying files.

      -----  The following switches limit files by the filetime -----

         /D  Same as /DA.
        /DA  Copies newer files and brand new files.
        /DB  Copies older files and brand new files.
        /DS  Copies only the files whose filetime is exactly the same.
        /DX  Copies only the files whose filetime is different in any way.

      Note:  All filetime comparisons are affected by the fuzzy range (/FF).

  /D:<date>  Same as /DA:<date>.
 /DA:<date>  Copies files that were changed on or after the specified date.
 /DB:<date>  Copies files that were changed on or before the specified date.
 /Do:<date>  Copies files that were changed on the specified date.
    /DA#<n>  Copies files that were changed on or after  <n> days ago.
    /DB#<n>  Copies files that were changed on or before <n> days ago.
    /Do#<n>  Copies files that were changed on the day   <n> days ago.

      Note:  A "brand new" file refers to a file which exists in the
             source directory but not in the destination directory
             (Micrososoft's Robocopy call it a "lonely file").

      Note:  With /DA#<val>, /DB#<val> and /DO#<val>, the parameter <val> will
             be treated as the number of Days unless it is appended with a
             one-letter suffix (D, H, M, or S which stand for Days, Hours,
             Minutes, or Seconds, respectively).  When <val> is given in
             the number of days, the exact time is midnight of the day.

             e.g., /DA#0 denotes files made some time today after midnight.
                   /DO#2 means all day the day before yesterday.
                   /DA#30m selects files made within the last 30 minutes.

      /DA:.  Copies files that were changed today or later (same as /DA#0).
      /DB:.  Copies files that were changed yesterday or earlier.
      /Do:.  Copies files that were changed today only.

             /DA:<val> and /DB:<val> work as a pair if both are specified.

             e.g., /DA:1997-01-01 /DB:1997-12-31  files made in 1997
                   /DA:1997-04-01 /DB:1997-04-30  files made in April 1997
                   /DB:1997-03-31 /DA:1997-05-01  exclude files made in April
                   /DA:1997-01-01 /DB:1997-01-01  try shorter /Do:1997-01-01

             Since the US and European conventions are not reconcilable,
             we recommend the ISO 8601 standard (YYYY-MM-DD) with a 4-digit
             year value followed by month and day.  If all values have two
             digits only, it is interpreted according to the system setting.
             A file date must be between 1970-01-01 and 2069-12-31.

             A partial date specifier is accepted for /DA:, /DB: and /DO:
             where yyyy-mm and yyyy denote the month and year respectively.
             E.g., /DO:2000-2 is equivalent to /DA:2000-2-1 /DB:2000-2-29,
             and /DB:1999 to /DB:1999-12-31, and /DA:2000 to /DA:2000-1-1.

 /DA:<time>  Same as /DA:<date> except an additional time value may be added.
 /DB:<time>  Same as /DB:<date> except an additional time value may be added.

             The <time> parameter starts with the <date> (as shown above)
             followed by 'T' or '@' and hh:mm:ss, hh:mm, or hh.

       e.g., 2002-10-25T15:25:30  (recommended as ISO 8601 std)
             31-10-2002@13:00   10-31-2002@13 (min and sec may be omitted)
             (/D0:<date> cannot be specified with the <time> value).

      Note:  /DA, /DB, /DX, /DS, /Do, /DA:<date> and /DB:<date> are mutually
             exclusive (except /DA:<date> and /DB:<date> work as a pair).

      Note:  /DA /DB and /DD, if date is omitted, are the same as /BN and /Bo
             except they can be combined with another /B switch (e.g., /BI).

      Note:  /DA, /DB, /DX and /DS compare source and destination files using
             both date and time whereas /DA:<date> and /DA#<n> use date only.

        /D0  Cancels all file-date related (/D...) switches.

      -----  The following switches modify filetime semantics -----

        /FW  Uses the Last-Write timestamp for Filetime (default).
        /FA  Uses the Last-Access timestamp for Filetime.
        /FC  Uses the Creation timestamp for Filetime.

             Note: /FW, /FA and /FC are mutually exclusive choices.

        /FL  Filetime in Local time (default).
        /FU  Filetime in UTC (Universal Coordinated Time - same as GMT).

             Note: /FL and /FU are mutually exclusive choices.

        /FF  Fuzzy Filetime (same as /FF2S --- matches within 2 sec).
       /FF0  Fuzzy Filetime cancelled (adjustment value set to +/- 0).
   /FF<val>  Fuzzy Filetime, adjust ref time +/- <val> seconds.
  /FF+<val>  Fuzzy Filetime, adjust ref time by adding <val> seconds.
  /FF-<val>  Fuzzy Filetime, adjust ref time by subtracting <val> seconds.

      Note:  With /FF<val>, /FF+<val> and /FF-<val>, the parameter <val> will
             be treated as the number of seconds unless it is appended with a
             one-letter suffix (D, H, M, or S which stand for Days, Hours,
             Minutes, or Seconds, respectively).

             e.g., /FF     treats file times within +/- 2 sec as the same.
                   /FF-1H  treats files older by up to 1 hour as the same.
                   /FF+2/FF-4 (you may choose asymmetric slack values).

      Note:  The /FF switch affects all filetime comparisons such as /CLONE,
             /BI,/BA,/BU,/BS,/BX,/BO,/BN,/DA,/DB,/DS,/DX,/TS and /TD.

      Note:  The FAT (DOS/Win9x) file system has a 2-second granularity in
             file time whereas NTFS, Unix and other file systems use finer
             time stamps.  The /FF switch is useful for incremental backup
             between volumes of different file systems.

      -----  The following switches cope with time zones -----

    /TS+<n>  Adds an offset to the time of source (and the copied ) file.
    /TS-<n>  Subtracts an offset time from source (and the copied) file.
    /TD+<n>  Adds an offset to the time of the destination file.
    /TD-<n>  Subtracts an offset time from the dst file for comparison.

      Note:  The offset value <n> for /TS and /TD is specified in hours
             unless it is appended with a one-letter suffix (D, H, M, or S
             which stand for Days, Hours, Minutes, or Seconds respectively).

      -----  The following switches control timestamps -----

       /TTA  Touches (modifies) timestamp of Last Access of src.
      /TTA0  Preserves timestamp of Last Access of src (default).

        /TC  Shortcut for /TCA/TCC/TCW (copies all three types of timestamps).
       /TC0  Shortcut for /TCA0/TCC0/TCW0.

       /TCA  Copies the timestamp of Last Access fm src to dst.
      /TCA0  Uses current time for dst Last Access (default).

       /TCC  Copies the timestamp of Create Time fm src to dst.
      /TCC0  Uses current time for dst Create time (default).

       /TCW  Copies the Last Write time fm src to dst (default).
      /TCW0  Uses current time for dst Last Write time.

      -----  The following switches qualify the source by file size -----

/SZ:<n>-<m>  Selects files whose size is between n bytes and m bytes.
   /SZ:<n>-  Selects files whose size is equal to or greater than n bytes.
   /SZ:-<m>  Selects files whose size is equal to or less than m bytes.
    /SZ:<n>  Selects files whose size is exactly n bytes.
/SZ!<n>-<m>  Selects files whose size is NOT between n bytes and m bytes.
   /SZ!<n>-  Selects files whose size is NOT equal to or greater than n bytes.
   /SZ!-<m>  Selects files whose size is NOT equal to or less than m bytes.
    /SZ!<n>  Selects files whose size is NOT equal to n bytes.
      /SZ:-  Disables size-based selection (/SZ!- also works).

      Note:  The size values <n> and <m> are entered in bytes unless appended
             with a suffix letter (K, M, G, T which stand for metric
             kilo (x1000), mega (x1000000), giga (x1000000000), or
             tera (x1000000000000), respectively).

      -----  The following switch limits the destination file size -----

     /TR<n>  Truncates the new file to (copies the first) n bytes.

      -----  The following switches deal with subdirectories -----

         /S  Copies directories and subdirectories except empty ones.
         /E  Copies directories and subdirectories, including empty ones.
             Same as /S /E.

         /T  Creates directory structure, but does not copy files.  It copies
             all directories including empty ones (implicitly sets /E).

        /SG  Same as /SGN (see variations in handling duplicates below).
       /SGF  Gathers files into one-level directory (unsorted First file 1st).
       /SGL  Gathers files into one-level directory (unsorted Last  file 1st).
       /SGN  Gathers files into one-level directory (sorted, Newest file 1st).
       /SGo  Gathers files into one-level directory (sorted, Oldest file 1st).
      /SGFo  Gathers files into one-level directory (First  only).
      /SGLo  Gathers files into one-level directory (Last   only).
      /SGNo  Gathers files into one-level directory (Newest only).
      /SGoo  Gathers files into one-level directory (Oldest only).
       /SG0  Cancels file-gather switches (/SG...).

      Note:  /SGL and /SGLo is works well with other file-selection switches.
             E.g., /SGLo /BZL to gather the largest file of its kind.

        /SL  Flattens subdirectories, add-name-Left   (see below).
        /SX  Flattens subdirectories, add-name-Middle (see below).
        /SR  Flattens subdirectories, add-name-Right  (see below).

             /SL, /SX, and /SR are the same as /S except the output files
             will be saved as a flat directory without adding levels of
             subdirectories.  The source subdirectory name will become a
             part of the target filename.  /SL and /SR add the subdir name
             to the left or right of the name respectively.

       /SLR  Rebuilds flattened directory (path to the left).
       /SXR  Rebuilds flattened directory (path in the middle).

     /DL<n>  Limits processing of directory nesting to n levels.
             /DL0 removes the limit.  /DL works only when /S or /E is set.

      -----  The following switches deal with the path length -----

        /VL  Enables the Very Long Path (same as /VL32767).
     /VL<n>  Sets the maximum path length to n chars (up to 32767).
       /VL0  Disables the Very Long Path (default with 259 chars).

/PL:<n>-<m>  Selects files whose full path length is between n and m.

   /PL:-<m>  Selects files whose full path length is m or less.
   /PL:<n>   Selects files whose full path length is exactly n.
/PL!<n>-<m>  Selects files whose full path length is NOT between n and m.
   /PL!<n>-  Selects files whose full path length is NOT n or greater.
   /PL!-<m>  Selects files whose full path length is NOT m or less.
    /PL!<n>  Selects files whose full path length is NOT equal to n.
      /PL:-  Disables path length-based selection (/PL!- also works).

      -----  The following switches check the destination directory -----

         /I  If destination does not exist and copying more than one file,
             assumes that destination must be a directory (no prompting).
             Note: when the destination specifier ends with a backslash,
             it declares as a directory which implicitly sets the /I switch.
        /IA  Continues if destination is absent (terminates if exists).
  /IA<item>  Continues if the specified item (file/directory) is absent.
        /IP  Continues if destination is present (terminates if absent).
  /IP<item>  Continues if the specified item (file/directory) is present.

        /CB  Continues batch file if XXCOPY ended OK last time.
       /CB0  Cancels the /CB and /CBQ switches.
       /CBQ  Same as /CB except suppresses console output to end immediately.

        /Y0  Same as above (also /Po or /-Y).
        /YY  Suppresses nearly all prompts (good for batch scripts).

      -----  The following switches control Remove (file delete) -----

        /RC  Removes files in src after a successful copy (equivalent to move).

      Note:  Whereas /Y and /-Y modify prompting for the copy action
             of /RC (Remove after Copy) switch, the suffix 'P' or 'Y' controls
             the prompt for the file remove action after copy.

      Note:  The suffix 'P' or 'Y' can also be added to any of /RS, /RD,
             or /RX switches which will insert or suppress respective prompt.
             For these remove-without-copy switches, the /Y and /-Y switches
             also control the prompt for the remove action.

      Note:  /RX can be thought of a /Z operation without copying files.
             In general, the /RS/BB combination (by swapping src and dst)
             provides more file-selection controls than the /RX switch.

      Note:  /PD and /PD0 control additional prompt on each directory.

     /RMDIR  Removes a directory.  Same as /RS/S/H/R/PD0/ED0.

      -----  The following switch copy files -----

      /CoPY  Copies files specified in the src specifier to the dst directory

      Note:  The /EDxx switches are in effect only with file/directory removal
             operations (/Z, /RC, /RS, /RD, /RX, and /CLONE cases).

      -----  The following switches control cyclic directory copy -----

        /CC  Warns a cyclic copy with a Y/N prompt.
       /CCY  Allows a cyclic copy by excluding the destination from the src.

      -----  Filename pattern matching  -----

         /N  Uses the short (8.3) name for name matching, and creation.
        /N0  Disables the /N feature (default, uses longname when applicable).

        /NX  Preserves the shortname when the file is copied.
       /NX0  Disables the /NX (shortname preservation) feature.

             Note: If src and dst are both local drive, the shortname will be
                   preserved (/NX) by default, but if either src or dst is
                   specified by a UNC (starts with \\), /NX0 is default.

        /NL  Renames longname to match the source (No copy operations).
        /NS  Renames shortname to match the source (No copy operations).
       /NC0  Disables /NCL, /NCU, or /NCX (accepts letters of both cases).
       /NCU  Uses Uppercase-only name when a new file is created.
       /NCL  Uses Lowercase-only name when a new file is created.
       /NCX  Uses Uppercase-only name when a new short-name file is created.
       /NoP  Performs no 'regular' operations (good for /MD, /WS, etc.).
        /NW  Uses the new (Win32) wildcard matching scheme.
        /ND  Uses the old (DOS) wildcard matching scheme.
             Note: /ND and /NW are mutually exclusive choices.

        /Q2  Does not display directories which are excluded.
        /Q3  Does not display file and directory names while copying.
     /WI<n>  Sets the output line width to n columns (default:auto).
        /ZS  Disables the sign-on message and statistics output.

      -----  The following switches control the log output -----

 /oA<fname>  Appends to a logfile, reporting errors. (does not overwrite log).
 /oN<fname>  Outputs a new logfile, reporting errors (make a new log) file.
        /oQ  Surrounds pathname output with a pair of quotation marks.
        /o0  Cancels the /oN or /oA switch specified earlier.

        /oR  Displays the target path of reparse point.
       /oR0  No display of the target path of reparse point.

          The screen and the log file output can be set by the following:

     /oB<n>  Brief switch (both specified and default) list.
     /oC<n>  Displays links (<LNK><JCT><MNT>) that are cyclically referenced.
     /oD<n>  Deleted-file list (by a /Z or /ZY switch).
     /oE<n>  Error summary with the system error code
     /oF<n>  File list (files which were successfully operated on).
     /oH<n>  Displays the list of hard link(s) to the selected file if linked.
     /oI<n>  Include-item (alternate file template) list.
     /oP<n>  Parameter (command switch detailed) list.
     /oS<n>  Skipped-file list (with the reason why skipped).
     /oX<n>  Exclude-item list.

         The suffix value <n> for /oB/oD/oE/oF/oH/oI/oP/oS/oX works as follows:

             0: No output
             1: Screen only
             2: Log file only
             3: Screen and Log file both

      Note:  It is advised that the log file created by /oA or /oN to be
             free from the names of successfully copied files that would
             overshadow relatively infrequent lines of error and warning.
             Instead, use the /Fo switch to create a separate file for a
             list of successfully copied files.

        /UT  Encodes output file(s) in UTF-8 text.
       /UT0  Encodes output file(s) in ANSI text (default).

     /DEBUG  Shows the command parameters and prompts you to start.
    /DEBUGX  Shows the command parameters and exits.
      /HELP  Shows the switches in detail (print this output).
   /HELP /X  Shows Partial Help (switches starting with letter X).
     /HELPA  Shows the /HELP listing in alphabetical order.
     /HELPE  Lists the Exit codes (ERRORLEVEL values) returned by XXCOPY.
         /?  Shows a summary of the switches on one page.
     ... /?  Shows related switches when entered with other switches.

      Note:  All XXCOPY command switches are case-insensitive.
             The alphabet, O, is rendered in lowercase (o) in this page to
             distinguish it from the numeric zero (0).

      Note:  Virtually all of the switches can be disabled by adding 0 (zero)
             at the end (e.g., /A and /A0).  Due to space limitation and

             their redundant nature, only some of these cases are listed in
             the help text.

      -----  Predefined macros to embed current date and time ----

    /$xxxx$  Predefined macros for current date and time which may appear
             anywhere in the command argument and other XXCOPY parameters.
             Examples below are for the current time, Dec 25, 2002 13:15:30.
    /$DATE$  Expands to month and date (equivalent to /$MMDD$) --> "1225".
    /$TIME$  Expands to hour and minutes (equiv. /$HHNN$) --> "1315".
  /$YYMMDD$  Expands to 2-digit year month day --> "021225".
 /$YYYY-MM$  Expands to 4-digit year month --> "2002-12".
  /$HHNNSS$  Expands to hour minutes second --> "131530".
  /$MON-DD$  Expands to month day --> "DEC-25".
/$II-IWK-K$  Expands to ISO 8601 year-wkno-dow --> "02-W52-3".

       /TM0  Cancels the time offset set by /TM+ or /TM-.
    /TM+<n>  Adds an offset to the current time of macro reference.
    /TM-<n>  Subtracts an offset to the current time of macro reference.

      Note:  The offset value <n> for /TM+ and /TM- is specified in hours
             unless it is appended with a one-letter suffix (D, H, M, or S
             which stand for Days, Hours, Minutes, or Seconds respectively).

      -----  Environment Variables in XXCOPY command files ----

    /%xxxx%  Environment variable (E-Var) reference in command files
             (/CF and /EX).  Like the macro reference counterpart,
             the string value which correspoinds to an E-Var can be
             brought in the command line text using the /%xxxx% syntax.
             Note that this syntax should be used only inside the
             external file text for XXCOPY (/CF and /EX) which cannot
             be processed by the OS's command processor.  That is, in
             the regular command line, the E-Var reference is already
             supported (without a leading slash as the prefix).


      -----  Installation of XXCOPY ----

   /INSTALL  Installs the XXCOPY software package on your computer.
   /INSTALL:<dir>   Installs XXCOPY in a user-specified directory.
    /SKIPIC  Skips the creation of XXCOPY Desktop Icon (used with /INSTALL).
    /SKIPXC  Skips the installation of XXConsole (used with /INSTALL).
 /UNINSTALL  Uninstalls XXCOPY from your computer.
   /LICENSE  Displays the XXCOPY license status on your computer.
     /HOSTS  Displays the names of remote hosts accessed by XXCOPY.
   /ADDHOST:<id>    Add a new computer name in the host list.

      -----  Environment variables that affect XXCOPY-----

    COPYCMD  Specifies file-overwrite prompting.
             /Y  suppresses the prompt (always overwrite)
             /-y prompts you for a Yes/No/All option for a file overwrite
             (This feature is for the COPY/XCOPY compatibility.)
     XXCOPY  Specifies XXCOPY's command argument.  This argument string
             is evaluated first and therefore the user-typed command line
             can override it.  The syntax is the same as regular argument.
    XXCOPYX  Specifies a list of exclusion specifiers (xspec).
             Do not use switch prefix (/X). See the /X switch for details.

        /ZE  Disables the use of all Environment Variables for XXCOPY.
        /ZX  Disables the use of the Environment Variable XXCOPYX.
       /ZX0  Enables the XXCOPYX settings.  Good for /CLONE and /RMDIR.

Summary   XXCOPY switches that check two directories:      -------
                                                          /  src  \
     Files are classified into four groups;               |    ---+---
    ---------------------------------------------         | A / B |   \
     A    files in src which do not exist in dst          |   |   |   |
     B    files in src which also   exist in dst          \   | C / D |
     C    files in dst which also   exist in src           ---+---    |
     D    files in dst which do not exist in src              \  dst  /
                                                               -------
 /BB   all files in A       (none in B)                    Venn diagram
 /BI   all files in A plus  files in B that are different in filetime or size
 /BA   all files in A plus  files in B that are diff. in filetime, size or attr
 /BX   all files in A plus  files in B that are different in filetime
 /BZE  all files in A plus  files in B that are the same size
 /BZL  all files in A plus  files in B that are larger
 /BZS  all files in A plus  files in B that are smaller
 /BZX  all files in A plus  files in B that are different in size
 /BN   all files in A plus  files in B that have newer filetime
 /Bo   all files in A plus  files in B that have older filetime
 /BE   all files in A plus  files in B that have exactly the same time and size
 /BS       (none in A)      files in B that have exactly the same time and size
 /U        (none in A)  all files in B (subject to other switches)
 /U/BI     (none in A)      files in B that are different in filetime or size

 Note:  all the variations in the backup switches (/Bx) include the files in A
        with the exception of /BS to be consistent with the spirit of BACKUP.
        As shown in the example (/U/BI), adding /U eliminates the files in A.

 /RS    files in A and/or B that satisfy other specified switches (for remove).
 /RC    same as /RS (for remove-after-copy).
 /RD        (none in D)     files in C that would be overwritten (for remove).
 /RX                    all files in D (for remove).

 Note:  /BS for copy usually accomplishes nothing but is useful as /RS/BS.
